# Paxel upload script
# ===================
#
# What this does (up to 17 steps):
#   On your machine
#     1. Check Docker is installed and running
#     2. Sign you in (browser-based device auth)
#     3. Pull or build the Paxel Docker image
#
#   Inside the container — file bodies stay local; only aggregate metrics +
#   metadata (paths, commit numstat, session events) are uploaded
#     4. Discover projects and sessions (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor)
#     5. Read your git history
#     6. Parse transcripts
#     7. Summarize each session (cloud Haiku via YC proxy)
#     8. Group git commits by session
#     9. Group sessions into multi-day work streams
#    10. Extract steering traces
#    11. Extract decision exchanges (cloud Haiku)
#    12. Redact code before upload (regex pattern redaction)
#    13. Link decisions to outcomes
#    14. Analyze code quality (L1 deterministic)
#    15. Score episodes across 5 axes (cloud Haiku)
#    16. Assemble your report
#    17. Upload redacted summaries + scores to the server
#
#   Then: opens your results in the browser
#
# Some steps are skipped when there's nothing to do (no new sessions, no
# work streams, no server to upload to). 17 is the ceiling; fewer can run.
#
# What stays on this machine:
#   File bodies (source code contents), full raw transcripts, and raw plan
#   file contents. Diffs never leave — only aggregate line counts do.
# What gets uploaded:
#   Scores, behavioral summaries, narrative outputs, redacted decision
#   records, session metadata (including file paths your agent Read/Edited/
#   Created and bash commands it ran), per-commit numstat (touched paths
#   with added/deleted line counts), git commit metadata (sha, author,
#   date, subject), aggregate velocity/LOC stats, and pipeline telemetry.
#   Transcript excerpts (including snippets of tool calls) flow to Claude
#   through the YC LLM proxy for narrative analysis — the proxy logs
#   request/response to our Postgres for anti-gaming verification. See
#   /data-handling for the field-by-field breakdown.
#
# Caches and re-runs:
#   LLM call results cache in a local Docker volume (paxel-cache-<uid>).
#   Re-running on the same repo (or after a mid-pipeline failure) typically
#   hits 95%+ cache and finishes in minutes instead of re-doing every step.
#   The container itself is --rm — nothing persists inside. Only the LLM
#   cache survives between runs.
#
# After the upload:
#   The server runs one more pass — cohort anomaly detection, cross-session
#   analysis via embeddings, narrative synthesis, and (after 3+ uploads)
#   builder profile updates. That takes ~1-5 minutes after the container
#   finishes. The results page polls automatically.
#
# Review it or ask your agent before running:
#   curl -fsSL 'https://paxel.ycombinator.com/upload/upload.sh' -o paxel-upload.sh && less paxel-upload.sh
#   curl -fsSL 'https://paxel.ycombinator.com/upload/upload.sh' | claude -p "explain what this bash script does"
#   curl -fsSL 'https://paxel.ycombinator.com/upload/upload.sh' | codex exec "walk me through this script"
#
# Usage:
#   upload                                        # Docker mode: analyze locally, upload scores
#   upload --project NAME                         # select project by repo name
#   upload --since 2m                             # sessions from last 2 months (recommended)
#   upload --all                                  # skip auto-detect; analyze every project
#   upload --no-repo                              # skip repo mount (transcripts only)
#   upload --no-sentry                            # disable client-side error reporting for this run
#   upload --clear-cache                          # clear project-remote cache

#
# When selected_remote is empty (--all mode), every Codex session is bucketed by
# its own remote. Sessions without a remote land in _codex_unattributed/.

#   * run_docker_analysis — produces the dir mounted as /codex_sessions:ro

# Extract opencode sessions from a SQLite DB into "opencode-native" JSONL.
# opencode stores sessions relationally (session/message/part tables, content in
# JSON columns), not as JSONL like Claude/Codex. We dump each top-level session
# to one file per bucket: line 1 is an opencode_session_meta marker (drives
# server-side format detection + the discoverer index + the sidecar), then one
# opencode_message line per message with its parts inlined. Each part carries
# its DB time_created as `t`; the server-side OpencodeNormalizer sorts by `t`
# and converts to canonical (SQLite's json_group_array does NOT reliably sort
# aggregate input, so we deliberately do NOT order parts in SQL).
#
# opencode `task`-tool subagents are child sessions (parent_id set). We emit each
# one at <bucket>/<parent_id>/subagents/<child_id>.jsonl — the SAME layout Claude
# subagents use — so TranscriptDiscoverer + find_jsonl link them as is_subagent
# children with ZERO server changes. Children are only emitted when their parent
# top-level session was extracted (its <bucket>/<parent_id>.jsonl exists), which
# keeps --since / --project scoping consistent.
#
# Buckets are keyed by the session's workspace directory (like Cursor), so two
# opencode workspaces in the same repo don't collide; the sidecar maps each
# bucket to a git_remote and the server collapses same-remote buckets into one
# Project. Requires sqlite3 (with JSON1) + jq.

# Recover a git or jj remote for a session whose cwd no longer exists on

# subdirectories or sibling worktrees. Returns "" on miss; callers decide
# fallback.
#
# Strategies, in order:
#   1. Ancestor walk — if a parent of $cwd is a live git repo (.git
#      present) or pure-jj workspace (.jj/ present), use its remote.
#      Low false-positive risk: a session inside a subdirectory usually
#      belongs to the enclosing repo. Pure-jj matches bypass
#      get_git_remote (which would walk past the marker via git's own
#      discovery) and call get_jj_remote directly, anchoring the lookup.
#   2. Sibling-worktree cross-reference — for stems of $(basename $cwd),
#      check if $parent/$stem is a git repo whose `git worktree list
#      --porcelain` still mentions $cwd. Catches worktrees removed with
#      `rm -rf` before `git worktree prune`. Git-only: jj's workspace
#      list semantics don't plug into this verifier directly.
#
# Conductor paths short-circuit at the top — those are handled by
# backfill_conductor_remotes, which understands fork/branch-specific
# remote semantics the ancestor walk would flatten.
#
# On successful recovery, appends $cwd to $_RMDC_LOG_FILE so callers can
# read a deduped count post-hoc. Counters-in-parent-scope don't work here:
# the resolver is invoked via $(...), which creates a subshell — in-function
# variable mutations don't propagate. A file append does.

# Cross-reference a dead cwd against a sibling jj repo's workspace list.
# Returns 0 if any of the sibling's workspaces has a root path matching the
# dead cwd (either as an on-disk root or via a resolved error-line path for
# a workspace whose dir was rm -rf'd without `jj workspace forget`).
#
# jj's workspace list template has no keyword for the stored relative path —
# `root` resolves it, and errors out inline when the path is missing. The
# error embeds the `../..` form (e.g. `<cand>/.jj/repo/../../../dead-ws`),
# which is bash-normalizable to the canonical path. Covers the
# non-Conductor dead-jj-sibling case: workspace dir deleted via filesystem
# rm, never through `jj workspace forget`. Conductor paths short-circuit at
# the top of `resolve_remote_for_dead_cwd` and route through
# PR #614's `project-remotes-v2.tsv` cache instead — this verifier is not
# reached for `*/conductor/workspaces/*` or `*/.conductor/*` cwds.

# tells docker "anonymous creds already exist for this registry," so it uses them
# and never consults any helper. We also carry over the active Docker context so
